# A-Comparative-Study-On-Recommender-System-Approaches
The subject of this paper is the presentation of Recommender Systems. The first chapters 
of the analysis focus on its significant diversification of application and its tremendous impact 
on modern online commerce and over-the-top media services. Many pages are spent on the 
theory behind the code, the parts of a recommendation system, and the metrics created to 
calculate its effectiveness. In the last part of the theoretical presentation, the sector's main 
challenges are presented alongside possible solutions.

The second segment focuses on the presentation of the code written for this project in the 
python language. For a deeper understanding and study of the topic, the MOVILENS 100K 
dataset was selected, 12 different recommendation algorithms were written using 2 of the 
most common approaches. The first group follows different uses of the Îš-nearest neighbor 
while the second two different applications of the Matrix Factorization approach. Also, four
different similarity measures were used for each of the first groups with surprising results. 
Following the execution, metrics were extracted to evaluate their performance using the 
metrics analyzed in the first segment. By comparing these metrics, we try to prove which
combination is the most suitable for the task. 

Through this analysis, this paper does not prove that the best method for this 
experimentation offers the best result in every instance. This thesis aims to experiment with 
and observe many different recommender systems inside a specific subsector. The results 
can provide particular knowledge in this confinement but an improved understanding in 
general.


The python code writter for this paper, the practical used of different techniques and philosophies as well as the extraction of the aforementioned conclusions will be posted
at  a later date.
